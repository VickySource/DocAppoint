🩺 PRECRIPTO

Precripto is a full‑stack healthcare appointment and prescription management platform built using the MERN stack. It enables patients to book doctor appointments, doctors to manage schedules and prescriptions, and admins to control and monitor the entire system — all from dedicated dashboards.

This project was built as a team effort with a strong focus on real‑world healthcare workflows, scalability, and clean system architecture.
